davfuse
=======

davfuse is a utility that allows you to transparently turn
[FUSE](http://fuse.sf.net/) file systems
into [WebDAV](http://webdav.org/) servers. On systems that
natively support mounting WebDAV servers,
like Mac OS X, it conveniently serves as an alternative to using the FUSE
kernel driver (via mounting "localhost").

It provides a library `libdavfuse` that emulates the necessary components
of the native FUSE library, `libfuse`. It also provides a wrapper script,
`davfuse`, that configures the system runtime linker to link against
`libdavfuse` instead of `libfuse` when running a FUSE file system.

When distributing applications based on FUSE file systems, you can link
directly against the library, or statically compile in each source file.
The advantage here is that you can drop a kernel module dependency for your
application if your system native supports mounting WebDAV servers.

Usage
-----

Using davfuse via the command line is simple and fun! Here we use it
with the wonderful [encfs](http://www.arg0.net/encfs) program.

    $ davfuse encfs ~/.private ~/private

Test with `curl` (store a file called foo on your FUSE file system):

    $ cat <<EOF | curl -T - 'http://localhost:8080/foo.txt'
    fizz buzz
    EOF

Platform Support
----------------

davfuse has been compiled and tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and Debian Wheezy
GNU/Linux. The author has no reason to believe that it should not
compile and run on other versions of Mac OS X and GNU/Linux but YMMV.
Additionally, The pure WebDAV component has been compiled and run
on Windows XP and Windows 7 using [MinGW](http://mingw.org/).

Compiling
---------

Compiling davfuse is simple and fun!

    $ cp config-linux-glibc-gcc.mk config.mk # customize for your system :)
    $ make RELEASE=1 davfuse

Binaries will be places in `out/targets`.

Also included is a test WebDAV server, it'll build on Windows (using MinGW) :)

    $ make RELEASE=1 webdav_server_sockets_fs_main
